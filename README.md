__My project idea:__ An app called "Overheard" (or something more creative; to be decided later)

__Programming language:__ Python (with Flask or Streamlit)

__Idea__:
There are several pages on Instagram and websites like "Overheard in New York" or "Overheard in London", and I thought it would be cool to make this into an 
app where people can directly submit things that they have overheard (instead of the Instagram page manager posting it). Further, it would not be restricted to a city,
but it will be a global edition.

While this is my basic idea, I would also like to use BERT (an open-source language model) for text classification and translation. In essence, I would like it to 
classify the overheard tips into categories, and I would like users of the app to write in any language (but for other users to be able to translate it and understand it).

__Rough idea for the interface__:
* A page to submit stuff you've overheard + a small box for the city/state/country you heard this in + small box for location in the city (e.g. bus / toilet)
* Sections that allow users to browse through overheard submissions - categorised by (1) place (city/country) or (2) location within a city (toilet/bus/restaurant) or (3) language  or (4) categories (so each section will have a dropdown/some way to choose an option)
* One page will consist of #trending submissions (I would also like an upvote button for each submission, so that particularly amusing submissions can be highlighted or put on one page)

__My notes__:
* Would like to focus more on the backend, but there is a risk of the focus moving a lot to the frontend and making the interface pretty (again, I would like to make it look nice too, so I'm conflicted)
* I think this might be too much, so worst case things don't work out, I'll ignore the BERT part of the project
