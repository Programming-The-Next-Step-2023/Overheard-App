### News App: 'The Buzz'

A news app made using the NewsAPI and Streamlit library on Python (for the course 'Programming: The Next Step' at University of Amsterdam). Check it out here: https://the-buzz.streamlit.app/.

__Guide to my repository:__

All my main code is in the `the-buzz-dir` folder. Here is a small run through of this folder:

* `01_Welcome.py` - code for the main app page (page 1)
* Folder `pages` - two files, `02_Top_Headlines.py` and `03_Contact.py`, which contain the code for page 2 and 3 of the app.
* Two test files - `test_api.py` and `test_getallnews.py`
* `functions.py` - all functions that I made for the app
* `thebuzz_vignette.ipynb` - my final report/vignette (__Note__: please see this file and not the vignette PDF file, this one looks better.)
* A bunch of png files (for the vignette)

If there are any issues, suggestions or fixes required for the app, you can contact me here: https://the-buzz.streamlit.app/Contact
