### News App

I had to come up with a new idea since my last two ideas had issues (with respect to feasibility). Hence I don't yet have many updates on my app. 

The idea is to use the NewsAPI for a web app on Python using the Streamlit library. People can just extract news based on keywords, or language, or country, or themes. The plan after this is to potentially integrate a text summariser option using BERT. However, the basic idea is a plain news app, and later add features once I have the basic skeleton. 

I have set up the package structure, and starting looking into Streamlit tutorials. But the development of the app will come soon!
